Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your continued review of Grace Academy. We sincerely apologize for any confusion regarding our business model. Please allow us to provide a comprehensive clarification:

---

1. BUSINESS MODEL SUMMARY

Grace Academy is an institutional educational platform operated by a registered educational organization in Iraq. We are NOT a digital content marketplace.

How our system works:
- Students physically visit our institution (academy/office) or contact us via Telegram
- Payment is collected OUTSIDE the app (cash at our office, bank transfer, or in-person payment)
- Our administrative staff manually grants access to the student's account after verifying payment
- The student uses the iOS app ONLY to access content they have already been granted access to

There is absolutely NO mechanism in the app to:
- Purchase any course or lecture
- Subscribe to any service
- Unlock content through payment
- Enter credit card or payment information
- Access any in-app purchase flow

---

2. APPLICABLE GUIDELINES

Our app complies with Guideline 3.1.3(b) - Multiplatform Services:

"Apps that offer content or services through a third-party web browser may allow users to access that content through the app without using in-app purchase, as long as the purchasing takes place outside of the app."

This is identical to how the following approved apps operate:
- Netflix: Users purchase subscriptions on the website, then access content in the app
- Kindle: Users purchase books on Amazon.com, then read them in the app
- Spotify: Users can subscribe on the web, then use the app to stream music

Similarly, Grace Academy users complete their enrollment at our institution, and the app serves only as an access portal for their pre-authorized content.

3. UI CHANGES MADE IN THIS VERSION

To ensure absolute clarity, we have updated all user-facing text in this new build to remove any language that could be misinterpreted as payment-related:

Previous Text → New Text:
- "طلب التفعيل" (Request Activation) → "طلب الوصول" (Request Access)
- "قيد التفعيل" (Pending Activation) → "قيد المراجعة" (Under Review)
- "مفعّل" (Activated) → "متاح" (Available)
- "غير متاحة" (Not Available) → "محتوى خاص" (Private Content)
- Lock icon → Info icon

The "Request Access" button simply sends a notification to our administrative staff via Telegram that a user is interested in a specific course. It does NOT initiate any purchase or payment flow.

4. ANSWERS TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

Q1: Who are the users that will use the paid content in the app?
Answer: Students who have enrolled with Grace Academy (our educational institution) and have been granted access by our administrative staff.

Q2: Where can users purchase the content that can be accessed in the app?
Answer: Content cannot be "purchased" in the traditional sense. Students enroll at our physical institution and pay (cash/bank transfer) outside the app. Our staff then grants access to their account.

Q3: What specific types of previously purchased content can a user access in the app?
Answer: Educational video lectures for university courses (dentistry, medicine, pharmacy, engineering, etc.) that have been assigned to their account by our staff.

Q4: What paid content, subscriptions, or features are unlocked within your app that do not use in-app purchase?
Answer: NONE. No content can be unlocked from within the app. All access is granted externally by our administrative staff after the student completes enrollment at our institution.

5. TEST ACCOUNT FOR REVIEW

To verify our claims, please use the following test account which has been pre-granted access to all content:

Phone Number: 7700000000
OTP Code: 123456 (fixed for testing)

You will see that all courses are accessible without any payment prompts or purchase flows.

---

CONCLUSION

Grace Academy is a reader app / content access portal for an educational institution. All transactions occur outside the app at our physical location. The app contains no in-app purchase mechanism because none is needed - users access content that has been assigned to them by our institution.

We respectfully request approval under Guideline 3.1.3(b) - Multiplatform Services.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need any additional clarification.

Best regards,
Grace Academy Team

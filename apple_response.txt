Dear App Review Team,

We appreciate your continued review of Grace Academy. We believe there has been a misunderstanding about our app's purpose, and we would like to clarify an important point:

---

GRACE ACADEMY IS A FREE, NON-PROFIT EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION

Grace Academy is a charitable educational initiative. We do NOT sell courses. We do NOT charge students. Our educational content is provided completely FREE OF CHARGE to verified members of our organization.

There is NO payment - not inside the app, not outside the app, not anywhere.

---

WHY WE VERIFY USERS

The reason we verify users is NOT to check if they paid - it is to verify their IDENTITY.

Our organization serves university students in Iraq. To protect our educational content from unauthorized distribution, we verify that each user is:
1. A real person (not a bot)
2. A registered member of our educational community
3. A university student in their stated field of study

This verification is similar to how a PUBLIC LIBRARY works:
- You register for a library card (free)
- The library verifies your identity
- You get access to books (free)
- There is no payment involved

---

THERE IS NO PAID CONTENT IN THIS APP

We want to be absolutely clear:

- We do NOT sell courses
- We do NOT charge membership fees  
- We do NOT accept payments
- All our educational content is FREE
- The only requirement is identity verification

The "locked" content you see in the app is locked because the user has not yet been VERIFIED - NOT because they haven't PAID.

---

WHY IN-APP PURCHASE DOES NOT APPLY

In-App Purchase is for selling digital goods. We are not selling anything. Our content is free.

Adding In-App Purchase would mean charging for something that we provide for free. This goes against our charitable mission.

We respectfully submit that Guideline 3.1.1 (In-App Purchase) does not apply to our app because:
1. We are a non-profit educational organization
2. We do not charge users for content
3. Content access is based on identity verification, not payment
4. There is no "purchase" - inside or outside the app

UI CLARIFICATIONS IN THIS VERSION

To avoid any confusion, we have updated our app's language:

PREVIOUS → NEW:
- "طلب التفعيل" (Request Activation) → "طلب التحقق" (Request Verification)
- "قيد التفعيل" (Pending Activation) → "قيد المراجعة" (Under Review)
- "مفعّل" (Activated) → "تم التحقق" (Verified)
- "غير متاحة" (Not Available) → "يتطلب التحقق" (Requires Verification)

These terms now clearly indicate that access is about VERIFICATION, not PAYMENT.

---

SUMMARY

- Grace Academy = FREE educational content
- No payments of any kind
- User verification is for identity, not payment
- In-App Purchase is not applicable because nothing is for sale
- This app is a free service for verified members of our educational community

REQUEST

We kindly request that you reconsider our app under the understanding that:
1. We are a non-profit educational organization
2. All content is free
3. Verification is for identity, not payment
4. Guideline 3.1.1 does not apply to free content

If there is any additional information we can provide to clarify our charitable mission, please let us know.

We also welcome a phone call to discuss this matter directly if that would be helpful.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Best regards,
Grace Academy Team
(A non-profit educational initiative)
